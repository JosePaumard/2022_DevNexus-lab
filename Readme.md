## Records

### Simple Records

This first set of exercises shows you the first basic elements you need to know on records:
- how you can create a record class,
- how you can add a custom constructor,
- how you can make a record comparable and sort records in a list,
- how you can add some validation rules on your records. 

### Less Simple Records

This second set makes you create a `Range` record, that implements the `Iterable` interface and some validation rules. 

### Harder Records

This third set makes you use defensive copy to ensure the immutability of the internal state of your record. A record may be built on mutable components, that should be copied when you create your record, and when you return the value of such a component. 

It then makes you create your own `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to define your own record identity. 

### Hard Records

This fourth set makes you analyze a CSV text file containing US cities, along with several information. You will map each line of this file in a `City` record and compute various things on the list of cities that you will get:
- sort them in the alphabetical order,
- find the city with the largest population,
- find the states references in this file,
- then build the histogram of the population per state,
- and lastly find the most populated state. 
This set makes you use records with the Stream API. 

### Challenge Records

This last set of exercises invites you to rewrite the code of the previous set, using records everywhere you can use them. Creating a record is (almost) free and can greatly improve the readability of your core, especially when you are writing complex data processing algorithms.
